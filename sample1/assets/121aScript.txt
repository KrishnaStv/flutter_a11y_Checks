INDIA is notorious for its complex tax system
00:08
Its almost impossible for new businesses and startups to understand the direct and indirect tax systems
00:15
this problem gets even more aggravated when constant changes are made to taxes with each financial year.
00:22
But things change with the new Goods and Services Tax
00:26
commonly known as GST.
00:29
Lets take an example,
00:31
Aditya would like to start a business in Delhi for which he needs raw materials from Beijing in China.
00:38
While importing, it would first land at a port
00:42
and then from there it would travel to the manufacturing centre
00:46
at Delhi via road passing through various states.
00:52
Now, when Aditya starts analysing the various taxes,
00:56
he needs to pay in the process of just transporting the material to his center,
01:02
he will loose his mind
01:05
In fact this happens with many budding entrepreneurs
01:09
who want to give shape to their dreams , but fail to, because
01:14
the complex tax structure in India is the biggest hindrance
01:19
First he needs to pay a customs duty along with the shipping charges
01:24
its fine up until this point
01:26
But to comprehend the complexity in the tax structure after this stage would drive any one crazy
01:33
He would have to pay central and state governments
01:37
Ten different Taxes
01:39
like central excise duty, Service Tax, VAT , Central Sales Tax, Octroi etc.
01:46
And not only this.
01:48
he also would have to pay tax on taxes already collected by the government
01:54
To understand this lets take a very simple example under the present tax system
01:59
A seller in Mumbai sells a product to a buyer in Nagpur.
02:03
On top of the price of the product Vat is being charged.
02:07
Now the same product is to be sold from Nagpur to Chennai
02:11
The seller in Nagpur increases the price to gain profit
02:15
Now on top of the new price including his profit
02:19
Central Sales Tax that is CST is added
02:23
The price of the product for the buyer in Chennai will comprise of
02:27
Cost of the product+VAT+profit+CST
02:33
Donâ€™t you see the cascading effect of taxes here?
02:37
So how does GST affect the taxation system.
02:40
The Goods and Services Tax promises to alleviate this problem among many others.
02:47
GST is a consumption based tax which is levied on sale,
02:52
manufacture and consumption of goods & services at a National Level.
02:57
Only one indirect tax has to be paid by the trade and industry
03:02
and all the other indirect taxes like sales tax, purchase tax, service tax, octroi etc. will be absorbed in GST
03:12
Exports and direct tax like income tax, corporate tax and capital gain will not be affected by GST
03:20
GST would apply to all goods other than
03:23
crude petroleum, motor spirit, diesel, aviation, turbine fuel and natural gas
03:30
It would apply to all services barring a few to be specified in the future
03:36
The proposed tax system will take the form of dual GST
03:40
which is concurrently levied by Central and State Government
03:44
This will comprise of, Central GST (CGST) which will be levied by centre
03:52
State GST (SGST) which will be levied by State
03:57
Integrated GST (IGST)- which will be levied by Central Government on Inter-state supply of goods and services.
04:05
So who is going to pocket the taxes?
04:08
In case of Intra state transactions seller collects both CGST and SGST from the buyer
04:16
CGST goes to central government and SGST goes to state government
04:22
And in case of Inter state transactions IGST will be levied on Inter State Transactions of goods and services
04:30
and the tax get transferred to the importing State
04:34
what would be the cost of the same product under GST system?
04:39
Product sold from a seller in Mumbai to a buyer in Nagpur
04:43
CGST and SGST is to be added
04:47
Now again the same product is being sold from Nagpur to Chennai
04:52
This is an inter state transaction, so IGST is applicable now
04:57
But wait a minute, isn't this tax on tax again?
05:02
So here is the twist
05:04
A tax has already been paid on the product in the form of CGST and SGST
05:11
so the buyer in Chennai gets a tax credit
05:15
And IGST gets reduced with the amount of CGST and SGST
05:21
this prevents the buyer from paying tax on tax
05:25
So under the GST system
05:28
the drawback faced by the manufacturers and business class
05:32
due to cascading effect of taxation and also complexity in comprehending indirect taxes
05:38
has been removed to some extent.
